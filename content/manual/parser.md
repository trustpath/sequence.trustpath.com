The `sequence` _parser_ takes the rules generated by the analyzer (and updated/corrected by some human) as well as the _sequences_ returned by the _scanner_ for log messages, and will identify the matching rule. Based on the matching rule, the _parser_ will tag all the recognized tokens with a semantic tag, as defined by the user.
